# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

A longtime software developer, I'm currently working at Nexient.

I live in upstate New York with my wife and two adorable dogs. I enjoy most forms of nerdery and am a great cook. Ask me about my macaroni and cheese championship trophy.

## Current Personal Projects
I'm dabbling in svelte. First target is to update my personal profile page.

## Older Projects
https://github.com/rzelazny/board-game-mongodb

A multiplayer online board game, practicing Javascript and websockets. I'll create a React front end once the main game logic is complete.
