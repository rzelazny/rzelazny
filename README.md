# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

A longtime StepWise software developer, I'm now a fullstack developer at Nexient.

I live in upstate New York with my wife and two adorable dogs. I enjoy most forms of nerdery and am a great cook. Ask me about my macaroni and cheese championship trophy.

## Current Personal Projects
https://github.com/rzelazny/board-game-mongodb

A multiplayer online board game, practicing Javascript and websockets. I'll create a React front end once the main game logic is complete.
