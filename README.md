# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

A longtime StepWise software developer, I'm now on my way to being a full stack dev.  

I live in upstate New York with my wife and two adorable dogs. I enjoy most forms of nerdery and am a great cook. Ask me about my macaroni and cheese championship trophy.

## Current Projects
I'm attending Rutger's Coding Bootcamp until mid-January.  

The current topic is Heroku deployments with SQL databases.
